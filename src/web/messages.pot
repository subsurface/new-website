"Subsurface can <strong>plan</strong> and <strong>track</strong> single- "
"and multi-tank <strong>dives</strong> using air, Nitrox or TriMix. It "

"One of the major strengths of Subsurface is its support of a wide range "
"of <strong>dive computers</strong> (see the <a %(link)s>list of supported"
" dive computers</a>). Subsurface can also import existing dive logs from "
"several sources including MacDive, Suunto DM3, DM4 & DM5, JDiveLog and "
"divelogs.de."

#: templates/home.html:110

"Another strength is its ability to <strong>visualize</strong> the depth "
"profile (and, if available, the tank pressure curve) in innovative ways "
"that give the user additional information on relative velocity, and "
"momentary air consumption, during a dive. Users who dive with "
"<strong>multiple dive computers</strong> can combine the data from each "
"of their dive computers into one dive – allowing visualization of the "
"data collected from multiple sources."

"In fall of 2011, when a forced lull in kernel development gave him a "

#: templates/home.html:124
msgid ""
"Linus worked with a team of developers, and Subsurface is the result. It "
"now supports Linux, Windows and MacOS and allows data import from many "
"dive computers and several existing divelog programs. It provides a quick"
" and easy way to see the key information provided by a modern dive "
"computer and lets users track a wide variety of data about their dives. "
"In fall of 2012 Dirk Hohndel took over as Subsurface maintainer."
