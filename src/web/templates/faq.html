Dives can be entered manually, via spreadsheets, directly from some other dive logging software, and most importantly from many dive computers. What if you change dive computers? This is no problem with Subsurface as it is not tied to a specific dive computer manufacturer. Tech divers will appreciate the dive planner which allows you to plan using VPM-B or BÃ¼hlmann ZH-L16. Testing bailout gases, comparing different gas mixes and gradient factors, and finally printing the plan is made easy. Subsurface is free and available on multiple platforms making it the perfect software for a wide range of scuba divers.") }}

If your old log software supports exporting the log book, we might well be able to import that (for example via CSV files or UDDF). However, usually support for importing the native format will help you to get more complete information into Subsurface. To implement support for the log format, we will need a sample log file. It would be great to have also a screenshot from
                the original log software or description of the dive that is shown on the sample log. Preferably we would like to have a reasonably simple dive to get basic support and another dive that has as many features enabled as possible (e.g. gas
                changes during the dive). Please post this information to the user forum or send it to the developer mailing list subsurface@subsurface-divelog.org. Unfortunately some of the log formats we have not been able to decipher (as some
                vendors have decided to encrypt their log files to increase the degree of lock-in of their customers), so there are no guarantees that this will bring support for your old log software, but it is worth a try.") }}
